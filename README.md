# Quiz-Analyze
# Project Overview 
This project focuses on extracting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data fetched from external sources (URLs). The objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generate actionable insights from different datasets. The key techniques include handling missing values, calculating descriptive statistics, visualizing distributions, and providing recommendations based on analysis.
# Setup Instructions:
 1. Environment Setup:
    Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary environment and 
    libraries installed. Follow the instructions below:
  1. Install Python:
     * Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
 2. Install Required Libraries
      Install the necessary Python libraries using pip
 3. Download the Code:
    Place the provided code in a .py or .ipynb file (for Jupyter 
    notebooks) in your project directory.
  #  Project Approach:
   1. Data Fetching:
      The project begins by retrieving data from external URLs. The URLs provide datasets in JSON format. The requests library is used to fetch the data, and json() is used to parse the response into a Python dictionary.
   2. Data Conversion:
      Once the data is retrieved, the JSON data is converted into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis. The conversion logic handles cases where the data could be in a list or dictionary format.
